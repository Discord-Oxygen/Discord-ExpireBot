# Dev Branch
**DO NOT** USE THIS BRANCH FOR PRODUCTION, its only for testing. This code didn't got tested and can also have a plenty of bugs. Its a work-in-progress. If things break, its not my fault :D.

# Discord-ExpireBot

This Bot allows you to let roles expire. If you set e.g. the @voted role to 12h, the role will get removed automatically 12h after obtaining. This is individual to all users on the guild. It also saves the obtaining time into a JSON File, so if the Bot gets temporary offline, it can handle this.<br>
